\section*{\emph{When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer}}
\paragraph{By Walt Whitman}~

\begin{verse}	
	When I heard the learn’d astronomer,\\	
	When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\\	
	When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\\	
	When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,\\	
	How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\\	
	Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,\\	
	In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\\	
	Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.

\paragraph{By Maya Angelou}~
\begin{verse}
	A free bird leaps\\
	on the back of the wind\\
	and floats downstream\\ 
	till the current ends\\
	and dips his wing\\
	in the orange sun rays\\
	and dares to claim the sky.
	
	But a bird that stalks\\
	down his narrow cage\\
	can seldom see through\\
	his bars of rage\\
	his wings are clipped and\\
	his feet are tied\\
	so he opens his throat to sing.
	
	The caged bird sings\\
	with a fearful trill\\ 
	of things unknown\\
	but longed for still\\
	and his tune is heard\\
	on the distant hill\\
	for the caged bird\\
	sings of freedom.
	
	The free bird thinks of another breeze\\
	and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees\\
	and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn\\
	and he names the sky his own
	
	But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams\\
	his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream\\
	his wings are clipped and his feet are tied\\
	so he opens his throat to sing.\\
	
	The caged bird sings\\

	sings of freedom.\\

\section*{\emph{The Mortician in San Francisco}}
\paragraph{By Randall Mann}~
\begin{verse}
	This may sound queer,\\
	but in 1985 I held the delicate hands\\
	of Dan White:\\
	I prepared him for burial; by then, Harvey Milk\\
	was made monument—no, myth—by the years\\
	since he was shot.
	
	I remember when Harvey was shot:\\
	twenty, and I knew I was queer.\\
	Those were the years,\\
	Levi’s and leather jackets holding hands\\
	on Castro Street, cheering for Harvey Milk—\\
	elected on the same day as Dan White.
	
	I often wonder about Supervisor White,\\
	who fatally shot\\
	Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Milk,\\
	who was one of us, a Castro queer.\\
	May 21, 1979: a jury hands\\
	down the sentence, seven years—
	
	in truth, five years—\\
	for ex-cop, ex-fireman Dan White,\\
	for the blood on his hands;\\
	when he confessed that he had shot\\
	the mayor and the queer,\\
	a few men in blue cheered. And Harvey Milk?
	
	Why cry over spilled milk,\\
	some wondered, semi-privately, for years—\\
	it meant “one less queer.”\\
	The jurors turned to White.\\
	If just the mayor had been shot,\\
	Dan might have had trouble on his hands—
	
	but the twelve who held his life in their hands\\
	maybe didn’t mind the death of Harvey Milk;\\
	maybe, the second murder offered him a shot\\
	at serving only a few years.\\
	In the end, he committed suicide, this Dan White.\\
	And he was made presentable by a queer.

	Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,\\
	And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,\\

	Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\\
	And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\\

	Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\\
	The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\\
	And on the pedestal, these words appear:\\
	My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;\\
	Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!\\
	Nothing beside remains. Round the decay\\
	Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare\\
	The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

\paragraph{By Robert W. Service}~
\begin{verse}
	{\itshape
	There are strange things done in the midnight sun\\
	\hspace{0.5em} By the men who moil for gold;\\
	The Arctic trails have their secret tales\\
	\hspace{0.5em} That would make your blood run cold;\\
	The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,\\
	\hspace{0.5em} But the queerest they ever did see\\
	Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge\\
	\hspace{0.5em} I cremated Sam McGee.
	}
	
	Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.\\
	Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.\\
	He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;\\
	Though he'd often say in his homely way that “he'd sooner live in hell.”
	
	On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.\\
	Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.\\
	If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;\\
	It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.
	
	And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,\\
	And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,\\
	He turned to me, and “Cap,” says he, “I'll cash in this trip, I guess;\\
	And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request.”
	
	Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:\\
	“It's the cursèd cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.\\
	Yet 'tain't being dead—it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;\\
	So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains.”
	
	A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;\\
	And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.\\
	He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;\\
	And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.
	
	There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,\\
	With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;\\
	It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: “You may tax your brawn and brains,\\
	But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains.”
	
	Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.\\
	In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that load.\\
	In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring,\\
	Howled out their woes to the homeless snows— O God! how I loathed the thing.
	
	And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;\\
	And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;\\
	The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;\\
	And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.
	
	Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;\\
	It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the “Alice May.”\\
	And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;\\
	Then “Here,” said I, with a sudden cry, “is my cre-ma-tor-eum.”
	
	Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;\\
	Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;\\
	The flames just soared, and the furnace roared—such a blaze you seldom see;\\
	And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.
	
	Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;\\
	And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.\\
	It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;\\
	And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.
	
	I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;\\
	But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;\\
	I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: “I'll just take a peep inside.\\
	I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked”; ... then the door I opened wide.
	
	And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;\\
	And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: “Please close that door.\\
	It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm—\\
	Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been warm.”
	
	{\itshape

\section*{\emph{My Voice}}
\paragraph{By Rafael Campo}~
\begin{verse}
	To cure myself of wanting Cuban songs,\\
	I wrote a Cuban song about the need\\
	For people to suppress their fantasies,\\
	Especially unhealthy ones. The song\\
	Began by making reference to the sea,\\
	Because the sea is like a need so great\\
	And deep it never can be swallowed. Then\\
	The song explores some common myths\\
	About the Cuban people and their folklore:\\
	The story of a little Carib boy\\
	Mistakenly abandoned to the sea;\\
	The legend of a bird who wanted song\\
	So desperately he gave up flight; a queen\\
	Whose strength was greater than a rival king’s.\\
	The song goes on about morality,\\
	And then there is a line about the sea,\\
	How deep it is, how many creatures need\\
	Its nourishment, how beautiful it is\\
	To need. The song is ending now, because\\
	I cannot bear to hear it any longer.\\
	I call this song of needful love my voice.

\section*{\emph{A Poem for Pulse}}
\paragraph{By Jameson Fitzpatrick}~
\begin{verse}
	Last night, I went to a gay bar\\
	with a man I love a little.\\
	After dinner, we had a drink.\\
	We sat in the far-back of the big backyard\\
	and he asked, What will we do when this place closes?\\
	I don't think it's going anywhere any time soon, I said,\\
	though the crowd was slow for a Saturday,\\
	and he said—Yes, but one day. Where will we go?\\
	He walked me the half-block home\\
	and kissed me goodnight on my stoop—\\
	properly: not too quick, close enough\\
	our stomachs pressed together\\
	in a second sort of kiss.\\
	I live next to a bar that's not a gay bar\\
	—we just call those bars, I guess—\\
	and because it is popular\\
	and because I live on a busy street,\\
	there are always people who aren't queer people\\
	on the sidewalk on weekend nights.\\
	Just people, I guess.\\
	They were there last night.\\
	As I kissed this man I was aware of them watching\\
	and of myself wondering whether or not they were just.\\
	But I didn't let myself feel scared, I kissed him\\
	exactly as I wanted to, as I would have without an audience,\\
	because I decided many years ago to refuse this fear—\\
	an act of resistance. I left\\
	the idea of hate out on the stoop and went inside,\\
	to sleep, early and drunk and happy.\\
	While I slept, a man went to a gay club\\
	with two guns and killed forty-nine people.\\
	Today in an interview, his father said he had been disturbed\\
	recently by the sight of two men kissing.\\
	What a strange power to be cursed with:\\
	for the proof of men's desire to move men to violence.\\
	What's a single kiss? I've had kisses\\
	no one has ever known about, so many\\
	kisses without consequence—\\
	but there is a place you can't outrun,\\
	whoever you are.\\
	There will be a time when.\\
	It might be a bullet, suddenly.\\
	The sound of it. Many.\\
	One man, two guns, fifty dead—\\
	Two men kissing. Last night\\
	I can't get away from, imagining it, them,\\
	the people there to dance and laugh and drink,\\
	who didn't believe they'd die, who couldn't have.\\
	How else can you have a good time?\\
	How else can you live?\\
	There must have been two men kissing\\
	for the first time last night, and for the last,\\
	and two women, too, and two people who were neither.\\
	Brown people, which cannot be a coincidence in this country\\
	which is a racist country, which is gun country.\\
	Today I'm thinking of the Bernie Boston photograph\\
	Flower Power, of the Vietnam protestor placing carnations\\
	in the rifles of the National Guard,\\
	and wishing for a gesture as queer and simple.\\
	The protester in the photo was gay, you know,\\
	he went by Hibiscus and died of AIDS,\\
	which I am also thinking about today because\\
	(the government's response to) AIDS was a hate crime.\\
	Now we have a president who names us,\\
	the big and imperfectly lettered us, and here we are\\
	getting kissed on stoops, getting married some of us,\\
	some of us getting killed.\\
	We must love one another whether or not we die.\\
	Love can't block a bullet\\
	but neither can it be shot down,\\
	and love is, for the most part, what makes us—\\
	in Orlando and in Brooklyn and in Kabul.\\
	We will be everywhere, always;\\
	there's nowhere else for us, or you, to go.\\
	Anywhere you run in this world, love will be there to greet you.\\
	Around any corner, there might be two men. Kissing.

	Yet those same hands can touch with such healing, irresistible tenderness\\
	That the haughty neck is happy to bow\\
	And the proud back is glad to bend\\
	Out of such chaos, of such contradiction\\
	We learn that we are neither devils nor divines
	
	When we come to it\\
	We, this people, on this wayward, floating body\\
	Created on this earth, of this earth\\
	Have the power to fashion for this earth\\
	A climate where every man and every woman\\
	Can live freely without sanctimonious piety\\
	Without crippling fear
	
	When we come to it\\
	We must confess that we are the possible\\
	We are the miraculous, the true wonder of this world\\
	That is when, and only when\\
	We come to it.

\section*{\emph{When You See Water}}
\paragraph{By Alice Walker}~
\begin{verse}
	When you see water in a stream\\
	you say: oh, this is stream\\
	water;\\
	When you see water in the river\\
	you say: oh, this is water\\
	of the river;\\
	When you see ocean\\
	water\\
	you say: This is the ocean's\\
	water!\\
	But actually water is always\\
	only itself\\
	and does not belong\\
	to any of these containers\\
	though it creates them.\\
	And so it is with you.

\section*{\emph{The Pale Blue Dot}}
\paragraph{By Carl Sagan}~


Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
